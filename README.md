# Iris-Flower-Classification

This project contains a machine learning model designed to classify Iris flowers based on their physical features, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on these measurements.

The model is trained to recognize patterns in the features of different Iris species. It uses various machine learning algorithms, including:
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  Logistic Regression
  Decision Tree
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Random Forest
